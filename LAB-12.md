# Directions
* refactor your app to use a router for your single resource
* refactor your routes so that requests use parameters instead of query strings
* refactor your app so the error-handling middleware is its own module


# Test 
* `GET` - request no longer have 400 test
* `PUT and POST` - test 400 for bad json
 * `DELETE` - test 404, for a DELETE request with an invalid or missing id
  * 404 for missing id because `DELETE /api/<simple-resource-name>/` is not a route
 * `DELETE` - test 204, with an empty response body for DELETE request with a valid id
